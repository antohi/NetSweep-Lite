# NetworkChecker üõ†Ô∏èüåê

**NetworkChecker** is a Python-based network diagnostics and cybersecurity tool I've been building while studying for my A+ and Net+ exams. It allows users to:

- Ping individual or ranges of IP addresses
- Perform quick or targeted port scans using Nmap
- Log detailed system, network, and scan information
- View and log scan results with clean formatting
- Leverage concurrency for fast batch scanning

# Future ideas: 
- Scan multiple ports and filter by opened
- Traceroute
