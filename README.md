NetworkChecker

A simple Python network diagnostic program that logs local network information and verifies if IP addresses are up or down using console-based pings. Built as a learning project while studying for CompTIA A+ and Network+.


# Features

- Retrieves local IP, default gateway, and DNS servers
- Uses concurrent threading to ping multiple IPs simultaneously
- Error handling for file access and ping related exceptions
- Modular design with `NetworkInfo` and `PingTool` classes
- Port Scanning: Scans specific ports on an IP address to check if they are open using Nmap.
