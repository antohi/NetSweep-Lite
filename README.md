# NetworkChecker üõ†Ô∏èüåê

**NetworkChecker** is a Python-based network diagnostics and cybersecurity tool I've been building while studying for my A+ and Net+ exams. It allows users to:

- Ping individual or ranges of IP addresses
- Perform quick, targeted, or deep port scans using Nmap
- Log detailed system, network, and scan information
- View and log scan results with clean formatting
- Leverage concurrency for fast batch scanning

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ IP Ping Tool with Range Support
- ‚úÖ Port Scanner with Single & Top-Port Modes
- ‚úÖ Local System & Network Info Logging
- ‚úÖ Threaded Concurrent Scanning
- ‚úÖ Regex-based Output Formatting
- ‚úÖ Scan Result Logging (to `net_log.txt`)
- ‚úÖ IP Validation

---

## Tech Used
- **Networking Tool:** Nmap (via subprocess)
- **Modules:**
  - `subprocess`, `platform`, `os`, `socket`, `re`, `ipaddress`
  - `datetime`, `concurrent.futures`, `logging`
- **Validation:** Custom IP validation using Python‚Äôs built-in `ipaddress` module
- **Multithreading:** Handled with `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **CLI Interface:** Interactive UI with menus

# Future ideas: 
- Scan multiple ports and filter by opened
- Traceroute
