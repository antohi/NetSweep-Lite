INFO:root:Description: The resolver in Unbound before 1.4.11 overwrites cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost domain names" attack.

INFO:root:CVE: CVE-2018-0006
INFO:root:Description: A high rate of VLAN authentication attempts sent from an adjacent host on the local broadcast domain can trigger high memory utilization by the BBE subscriber management daemon (bbe-smgd), and lead to a denial of service condition. The issue was caused by attempting to process an unbounded number of pending VLAN authentication requests, leading to excessive memory allocation. This issue only affects devices configured for DHCPv4/v6 over AE auto-sensed VLANs, utilized in Broadband Edge (BBE) deployments. Other configurations are unaffected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R6-S2, 15.1R7; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R5-S1, 16.1R6; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S2, 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S5, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R2.

INFO:root:CVE: CVE-2022-30698
INFO:root:Description: NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.16.1 is vulnerable to a novel type of the "ghost domain names" attack. The vulnerability works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a subdomain of a rogue domain name. The rogue nameserver returns delegation information for the subdomain that updates Unbound's delegation cache. This action can be repeated before expiry of the delegation information by querying Unbound for a second level subdomain which the rogue nameserver provides new delegation information. Since Unbound is a child-centric resolver, the ever-updating child delegation information can keep a rogue domain name resolvable long after revocation. From version 1.16.2 on, Unbound checks the validity of parent delegation records before using cached delegation information.

INFO:root:Description: NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.16.1, is vulnerable to a novel type of the "ghost domain names" attack. The vulnerability works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a rogue domain name when the cached delegation information is about to expire. The rogue nameserver delays the response so that the cached delegation information is expired. Upon receiving the delayed answer containing the delegation information, Unbound overwrites the now expired entries. This action can be repeated when the delegation information is about to expire making the rogue delegation information ever-updating. From version 1.16.2 on, Unbound stores the start time for a query and uses that to decide if the cached delegation information can be overwritten.
